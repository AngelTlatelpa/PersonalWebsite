            Hello, My name is Angel Tlatelpa. I am a highschool graduate from New York Harbor School. I am 18 years old
            and I live in Brooklyn with my family. I have one older sibling and one younger sibling. My 2 passions
            are engineering and skateboarding, and I am very set in engineering. I have so much fun creating and 
            building things. I love it but I love it more when I am working with a team. One of my life goals is to build something cool with a
            bumch of people becase it sounds fun. In highschool, I was introduced to engineering, for example, a basic touch in 3D modeling and Arduino. 
            For the fall and spring, I am attending CCNY for a year and maybe transferring to a better college if I get a better school offer. I love NYC but I think it's time to move on.
            The Coronavirus pandemic affected my decision to stay in NYC since I didn't want to be paying a college "out of state tuition" and be quarantined. 
            My parents were also not cool with the idea of me planning to leave during a crisis, but now that things are calming down I'll just have to wait till next year to leave NYC.
